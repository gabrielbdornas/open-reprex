I'm studying Java and want your help to answer a question using between 350 and 400 words. The question is:

In the context of Java programming, compare and contrast the usage of if-else statements and switch statements. Analyze the benefits and drawbacks of each approach with regards to factors such as readability, maintainability, performance, and code organization. Share your personal experiences and provide real-world examples where you have encountered situations where one approach was more effective or efficient than the other. Furthermore, explore scenarios where a combination of if-else and switch statements can be employed to achieve the desired outcome.
